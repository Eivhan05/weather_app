This project is a simple weatherapp using weatherstacks api! https://weatherstack.com/
If you want to use the program remember to change line 193 to your own api key.

-This project fetches real time data from an api to display the weather in chosen locations!
-I've also added a feature that let's the user save up to 3 locations and it gets stored in the .txt file called "favorites_data".
-Download the font "Montserrat" or the program wont work.

Thanks for checking it out :)
